              <p>
                Welcome to the system tutorial. This guide provides all the
                tools and knowledge you need to operate the platform
                effectively. We'll walk you step-by-step through the key
                processesâ€”from the simple registration process, through managing
                your personal profile and viewing orders, all the way to
                performing advanced administrative actions. By the end of this
                tutorial, you'll be able to use all the system's features with
                complete confidence. Let's get started.

              <h4>User Guide: User Details Page</h4>
              <p>
                This page displays the detailed profile information for a
                specific user. As a regular user, you can only view your own
                profile. As an Administrator, you can access this page for any
                user in the system.
              </p>
              <h5>Displayed Information</h5>
              <p>
                The page is organized into three main sections: User
                Information, Address, and Passport Details. The "Role" field
                will clearly indicate if the user is a Customer, Agent, or
                Admin.
              </p>
              <h5>Available Actions & Buttons</h5>
              <p>
                At the top-right of the page, you will find several action
                buttons. The buttons you see depend on your role and whether you
                are viewing your own profile or someone else's.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Edit Profile (Pencil Icon):</strong> This button is
                  only visible on <strong>your own</strong> profile page.
                  Clicking it will take you to the 'Edit Profile' form, where
                  you can update your details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Change User Role (Role Icon):</strong> This button is
                  available only to <strong>Admins</strong> when viewing another
                  user's profile. It opens a window to change the user's system
                  role (e.g., from Customer to Agent).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reset Password (Key Icon):</strong> This allows an
                  authorized user (like an Admin) to begin the password reset
                  process for the account being viewed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Delete User (Trash Icon):</strong> This option is for
                  permanently removing a user from the system. It will open a
                  confirmation window before proceeding, as this action is
                  irreversible.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Actions like deleting a user, resetting a
                password, or changing a role will open a pop-up window (modal)
                asking you to confirm your choice before the action is
                finalized.

              <h4>Password Management and Reset</h4>
              <p>
                There are two ways to update or reset a password in the system,
                depending on your needs and permissions.
              </p>
              <h5>Option 1: Updating Your Own Password</h5>
              <p>
                As a user, you can change your own password at any time from
                your profile page.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Navigate to your profile by clicking the 'Edit Profile' link
                  in the sidebar or on your details page.

                <li>Enter your new, secure password.</li>
                <li>Click the 'Save Changes' button to finalize the update.</li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Option 2: Admin-Initiated Reset</h5>
              <p>
                This option is used when a user has forgotten their password and
                is unable to log in. Only an Administrator can perform this
                action.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  An <strong>Administrator</strong> navigates to the specific
                  user's 'User Details' page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Admin clicks the <strong>Reset Password</strong> button
                  (key icon).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A confirmation window will appear to prevent accidental
                  resets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upon confirmation, the user's password will be changed to a
                  temporary, default password.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>Important Security Note:</strong> After an Admin resets
                your password, you should log in immediately using the default
                password and then follow the steps in 'Option 1' to set a new,
                private password.

                To create a new Agent account, a specific two-step process must
                be followed:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  First, the new user must create an account using the standard{" "}
                  <strong>Registration page</strong>. This automatically assigns
                  them the default 'Customer' role.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After registration, an <strong>Administrator</strong> must go
                  to that new user's 'User Details' page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Admin must then use the <strong>Change User Role</strong>{" "}
                  function to promote the user from 'Customer' to 'Agent'.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> This role change must be completed{" "}
                <strong>before</strong> the new user attempts to perform any
                agent-specific actions in the system.
              </p>

              <h5>The User Tables</h5>
              <p>
                The page is divided into two main tables to help you easily
                distinguish between standard users and internal staff:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Users Manager Table:</strong> This table lists all{" "}
                  <strong>Customer</strong> accounts. It's useful for viewing
                  your entire customer base and accessing their profiles to see
                  their order history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Agents Manager Table:</strong> This table lists all{" "}
                  <strong>Agent</strong> and <strong>Admin</strong> accounts. It
                  provides an overview of your internal team, their roles, and
                  their current order counts.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>

                  to their detailed profile page, where you can perform actions
                  like changing their role or resetting their password.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Viewing Orders:</strong> The <strong>Orders</strong>{" "}

              <p>
                At the bottom of the page, this section provides a quick visual
                summary of the current workload for each of your agents. Each
                progress bar shows the total number of orders assigned to an
                agent, and the color changes (green to yellow) to indicate a
                higher workload, helping you balance assignments effectively.

              <h4>The Order Process Workflow</h4>
              <p>
                Creating and finalizing an order is a multi-step process
                involving different user roles to ensure all details are correct
                and confirmed. Here is a step-by-step overview of the workflow:
              </p>
              <h5>The Workflow Steps</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>1. Order Creation:</strong> The process begins when a{" "}
                  <strong>Customer</strong> submits a new order request through
                  the 'Create New Order' form.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>2. Agent Assignment:</strong> An{" "}
                  <strong>Administrator</strong> reviews the new request and
                  assigns an <strong>Agent</strong> to handle the specifics of
                  the booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>3. Agent Processing:</strong> The assigned{" "}
                  <strong>Agent</strong> works on the order, confirms all
                  details, and updates it with a final price.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>4. Customer Approval:</strong> Once the agent's
                  updates are complete, the order is sent to the{" "}
                  <strong>Customer</strong> for final review and approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>5. Final Decision:</strong> The customer then has two
                  options:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>If Approved:</strong> The order is confirmed and
                      finalized. It can no longer be edited by the customer or
                      agent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>If Rejected:</strong> The order's status reverts,
                      allowing for further edits before it is sent for approval
                      again.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Special Admin Permissions</h5>
              <p>
                It is important to note that an <strong>Administrator</strong>{" "}
                has the ability to edit any order, update its status, or cancel
                it at any stage, regardless of its current approval status.

                  <strong>2. Agent Assignment:</strong> An{" "}
                  <strong>Administrator</strong> reviews the new request and
                  assigns an <strong>Agent</strong> to handle the specifics of
                  the booking.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>3. Agent Processing:</strong> The assigned{" "}
                  <strong>Agent</strong> works on the order, confirms all
                  details, and updates it with a final price.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>4. Customer Approval:</strong> Once the agent's
                  updates are complete, the order is sent to the{" "}
                  <strong>Customer</strong> for final review and approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>5. Final Decision:</strong> The customer then has two
                  options:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>If Approved:</strong> The order is confirmed and
                      finalized. It can no longer be edited by the customer or
                      agent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>If Rejected:</strong> The order's status reverts,
                      allowing for further edits before it is sent for approval
                      again.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

              <h4>User Guide: Order Details Page</h4>
              <p>
                This page provides a complete, in-depth view of a single order.
                It's the central hub for tracking an order's progress, viewing
                all its information, and taking necessary actions.
              </p>
              <h5>Understanding the Layout</h5>
              <p>
                The page is divided into three main sections to organize all the
                information clearly:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Flight Details:</strong> Shows the departure and
                  return flight information, including dates, times, and flight
                  numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Passengers:</strong> Lists every passenger included in
                  the order with their personal and passport details.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>General Details:</strong> Displays the overall order
                  status, final price, and any additional notes.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Main Action Buttons (Top Right)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Contact Info (Info Icon):</strong> As a customer, this
                  shows your agent's contact details. As an agent or admin, it
                  shows the customer's contact information.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Delete/Cancel Order (Trash Icon):</strong> This button
                  appears only when the order is in an editable state. It allows
                  you to request the cancellation (or deletion for Admins) of
                  the entire order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Return to Orders (Arrow Icon):</strong> This button
                  will take you back to your main orders list page.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Editing an Order</h5>
              <p>
                Editing actions are only available when an order has a status
                that allows for changes (e.g., 'In Progress'). When an order is
                editable, you will see pencil icons next to the sections you can
                modify.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Editing Flights and General Details:</strong> Use the
                  pencil icon in each section to open a window where you can
                  update flight times, prices, or notes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Managing Passengers:</strong> You can add a new
                  passenger (+ icon), edit an existing passenger's details
                  (pencil icon), or remove a passenger (trash icon).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>The Approval Process (For Customers)</h5>
              <p>
                When an Agent has finalized your order details and price, the
                order's status will change to{" "}
                <strong>'Pending Customer Approval'</strong>. At this point, a
                prominent <strong>Approve</strong> button will appear on the
                page. Clicking this will open a window where you can formally
                approve or reject the agent's proposed booking.
              </p>
            </div>
            <hr className="my-4" />
            <div id="OrdersManager">

              <div className="d-block" style={{ height: "70px" }}></div>
              <h4>Admin Guide: Orders Manager Page</h4>
              <p>
                The Orders Manager is the central dashboard for{" "}
                <strong>Administrators</strong> to monitor and manage all orders
                within the system. This page is accessible only to users with
                Admin privileges.
              </p>
              <h5>The Dashboard Overview</h5>
              <p>
                At the top of the page, you will find a set of progress bars
                that provide a real-time statistical overview of all orders.
                They are categorized by their current status (e.g., Pending, In
                Progress, Confirmed), showing both a percentage and a direct
                count for each category.
              </p>
              <h5>The Main Orders Table</h5>
              <p>
                Below the dashboard, a comprehensive table lists every order in
                the system. Several columns in this table are interactive to
                help you manage the workflow:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Order Number:</strong> Clicking on a specific order
                  number will navigate you to the detailed view for that order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Status:</strong> This column is color-coded for quick
                  visual identification of an order's state (e.g., green for
                  Confirmed, red for Cancelled).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Agent:</strong> This is a key action column. If an
                  order is pending and has no agent, you will see a{" "}
                  <strong>link icon</strong>. Clicking this opens a window where
                  you can <strong>assign an Agent</strong> to the order. If an
                  agent is already assigned, their name is displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Customer:</strong> Clicking on the customer's name
                  will take you directly to that user's profile page.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Key Admin Actions from this Page</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monitor:</strong> Use the progress bars to get a quick
                  pulse on the overall order pipeline and identify bottlenecks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Assign:</strong> Your primary task here is to assign
                  new, unassigned orders to your Agents via the link icon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Investigate:</strong> Use the links in the table to
                  quickly navigate to specific order or user details when
                  needed.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Deleting an Order (Admin Only)</h4>
              <p>
                The ability to delete an order is a powerful, admin-only feature
                designed for specific situations. It permanently removes all
                records of an order from the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> Deleting an order is{" "}
                <strong>irreversible</strong> and cannot be undone. This feature
                should only be used to correct critical mistakes, such as a
                duplicate order created in error. For all other cases where an
                order is not proceeding, you should <strong>cancel</strong> the
                order instead.
              </p>
              <h5>How to Delete an Order</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  As an <strong>Administrator</strong>, navigate to the 'Order
                  Details' page of the order you wish to permanently delete.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the top-right action bar, locate the red button with the{" "}
                  <strong>trash can icon</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Click the button. A confirmation pop-up will appear to prevent
                  accidental deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To proceed, confirm the action in the pop-up window. The order
                  will then be permanently removed.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Delete vs. Cancel: When to Use Each</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Delete Order:</strong> Use only to correct significant{" "}

              <h4>User Guide: Updating an Order</h4>
              <p>

                form displayed in this window is specific to the section you
                choose to edit.

                customer.

              <h4>Approving Your Order (For Customers)</h4>
              <p>
                This is the final step to confirm your booking. After an Agent
                has prepared all the details and set the final price for your
                order, its status will change to{" "}
                <strong>'Pending Customer Approval'</strong>. At this point, you
                will need to give your final confirmation.
              </p>
              <h5>How to Approve Your Order</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Navigate to the <strong>'Order Details'</strong> page for the
                  order that requires your approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will see a prominent <strong>Approve</strong> button
                  displayed on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Clicking this button will open a confirmation window where you
                  will be asked to make your final decision.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Making Your Decision</h5>
              <p>In the confirmation window, you will have two choices:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>To Approve:</strong> If all the flight details and the
                  price are correct, confirm your approval. The order's status
                  will permanently change to <strong>'Confirmed'</strong>, and
                  your booking will be finalized. The order can no longer be
                  edited after this point.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>To Reject:</strong> If you find an issue or do not
                  agree with the details, you can reject the order. The order's
                  status will revert to <strong>'In Progress'</strong>, which
                  notifies the Agent that further changes are needed.
