        I've always been drawn to the world of technology, but after my military
        service, I decided to turn that curiosity into a profession. From the
        very first moment of my programming course, I knew I had found my true
        passion: the ability to translate complex ideas into clean code and
        elegant solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, as a Full-Stack Developer, I specialize in building dynamic and
        interactive applications using React for the front-end, and developing
        robust, efficient back-end systems with Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that quality code isn't just about what worksâ€”it's about
        creating solutions that are readable, maintainable, and designed for
        future growth. This philosophy guides every project I undertake.
